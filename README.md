# Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

This project involves cleaning a **Layoffs Dataset** using **SQL** to make it suitable for visualization and analysis. The dataset contained raw and unstructured data, which was transformed into a well-organized and usable format. This project demonstrates proficiency in **data cleaning** techniques and the use of **MySQL** for managing and refining datasets.
